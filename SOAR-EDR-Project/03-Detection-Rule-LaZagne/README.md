## **Objective**

- Detect the execution of LaZagne on endpoints.
- Generate alerts in LimaCharlie EDR.
- Trigger automated response in Tines SOAR.

## **Testing the Rule**

1. Run LaZagne on a test endpoint.
2. Confirm that LimaCharlie triggers an alert.
3. Verify that the alert is sent to **Tines SOAR**.
4. Document:
   - Endpoint affected
   - Alert timestamp
   - Screenshot of alert in LimaCharlie
